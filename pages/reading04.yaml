  ## Reflections

  In these essays, [Paul Graham] paints[^1] a portrait of the modern [hacker],
  who though "unruly" is a "maker" that "learn[s] ... by doing" and is "the
  essence of Americanness".

  For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
  perform the readings and participate in class:

  - How does [Paul Graham]'s vision of a [hacker] compare and contrast with the
  description provided by [Steven Levy] in [Hackers: Heroes of the Computer
  Revolution]?

  - What passages or arguments in [Paul Graham]'s essays regarding [hacker]s
    did you find compelling or interesting?

  - What passages or arguments in [Paul Graham]'s essays regarding [hacker]s
    did you find disagreeable or misguided?

  - What is your personal reaction to [Paul Graham]'s modern version of the
  [hacker]:  Do you identify with the type of person [Paul Graham] describes or
  do you find it uninteresting or perhaps offputting?

  Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
  Instead, the questions are there to help you brainstorm about the question:

  > Is [Paul Graham]'s version of a [hacker] compatible with [Steven Levy]'s
  description?  Do his arguments for and description of the modern [hacker]
  change your mind about what it means to be a [hacker] or the desirability of
  being one?
