  **Everyone**:

  The first book of the semester, [Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution],
  examines the origin of [Hackers] and their associated culture and philosophy.
  In doing so, the book recounts elements of computing history that many
  students may be unfamiliar with.

  For the first project, you are to work in groups of **2 - 3** students to
  modify or re-create a computing artifact from the past that runs in a
  **resource constrained environment**. What this means is that the software
  you develop should run in an environment with low resources (CPU, memory,
  disk, etc.) such as an [Arduino], a [Raspberry Pi], or an [emulator] such as
  [DOSBox].

  In addition to creating a software or hardware artifact, students must also
  provide a presentation on the background or context of their chosen
  historical artifact and its significance in computing history.

  ## Requirements

  Working in groups of **2 - 3**, students must create a software or hardware
  artifact that meets the following requirements:

  1. The artifact is grounded in some element of computing history.

  2. The artifact is interactive and is capable of being manipulated by a user
  via some sort of input device.

  3. The artifact should run in a resource constrained environment.

  4. The source code is stored on an online repository such as [GitHub],
  [GitLab], or [Codeberg].

  5. The project includes sufficient documentation to build, deploy, and use
  the artifact.

  6. The project `README.md` must explain the project and its context in terms
  of computing history and the importance of the historical artifact (between
  **250** - **500** words).

  #### <i class="fa fa-history"></i> Keeping it Old School

  Because the purpose of the project is to provide you an opportunity to
  experience what it was like to program on old (ie. resource constrained)
  computing system, you should avoid using modern programming languages and
  libraries such as [Python] and [PyGame]. Instead, you should focus on [C],
  [C++], [Scheme], [LISP], or even [assembly] and render your graphics
  directly.

  That said, the artifact, platform, and tools is mostly up to you; use this
  opportunity to explore something interesting to you.

  If in doubt, ask the instructor if you can utilize a particular tool or
  library.

  </div>

  ## Ideas

  Here is a list of possible project ideas:

  1. Write a text-based MUD such as [Zork], [Adventure], [NetHack], or [Rogue].

  2. Compose a musical and graphical demo akin to the [Commodore 64 demos].

  3. Program a game in [QBasic] such as [Nibbles] or [Gorillas].

  4. Prototype an interpreter for [LISP], [FORTH], or [BASIC].

  5. Re-create a classic game such [SpaceWar!], [Pac-Man], [Breakout], [Frogger].

  6. Develop a machine emulator for the [Z80], [8086], or [M68K].

  7. Create a telnet [BBS] system such as [Community Memory], [PLATO], or [CBBS].

  8. Construct a chat bot like [ELIZA].

  9. Mod an old game like [Doom].

  10. Write a program that generates/plays music (ala [Samson] or Dompier) (perhaps using [MIDI]).

  11. Develop a game an [Arduino] kit such as the [Arduboy].

  12. Write some **obfuscated code** ala [IOCCC].

  13. Produce a [coding quine].

  14. Animate a short visualization or story using low-level graphics primitives.

  15. Write an **Albacore** simulator or assembler.

  <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-code"></i> MVP

  Because of the short time-frame, it is not expected that your artifact be
  polished or feature complete.  Instead, it should be more along the lines of
  a prototype or [MVP] (e.g. a cool [hack]).

  </div>

  ## Timeline

  Here is the project timeline:

  <table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <th>Date</th>
    <th>Milestone</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Thursday, September 05</td>
      <td>Proposal</td>
      <td>Description of proposed project.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Thursday, September 12</td>
      <td>Progress</td>
      <td>Status report of current progress.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Thursday, September 17</td>
      <td>Hackathon</td>
      <td>Group work period.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Thursday, September 19</td>
      <td>Presentation</td>
      <td>In-class presentations and demonstrations.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

  More details about each of these milestones is described below.

  ### Proposal

  Your group must submit a proposal document by **midnight Thursday, September
  5**, which provides the following information:

  1. Lists the group members and each of their proposed roles.

  2. Describe the proposed project and how it meets the project requirements.

  3. Enumerates any resources required.

  <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-money"></i> Hardware Resources

  If you need any hardware resources such as an [Arduboy] or a [Raspberry Pi],
  please let the instructor know and he will see if he can procure your
  requests. Please do this sooner rather than later.

  </div>

  ### Progress

  Your group must submit a proposal **slide deck** (**5 - 8** slides) by
  **midnight Thursday, September 12**, which provides the following
  information:

  1. Addresses the questions and expectations in feedback email provided
  regarding the project proposal.

  2. Summarizes the work done this far, in particular the design and
  implementation details of your artifact.

  3. Enumerates the remaining tasks, with specifics on what you plan on
  accomplishing during the upcoming sprint week and what you realistically plan
  on accomplishing before the deadline.

  4. Itemize contributions to the project thus far and what how each member
  will aid in completing the tasks above.

  <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  If possible, provide **video** or **image** evidence of your project and your
  progress.
  </div>

  ### Presentation

  Because we are aiming for a [Homebrew Computer Club] style presentation, we
  will basically organize a "science fair" style demonstration environment:

  > Each group will setup a **booth** which will present information about
  > their project and allow other students to interact with their artifact.
  >
  > During class, students will be allowed to visit other **booths** to try
  > out the artifacts and to learn about the computing history involved with each project.

  Think of it like a mini "science fair".  In addition to the interactive
  artifact or demonstration, each group booth should also provide the following
  information:

  1. Explain the historical context and background of your artifact.

  2. Describe the overall design and implementation of the artifact (and how
  each person contributed), focusing on the key concepts and ideas.

  3. Summarize what was accomplished and what was learned.

  This information can be presented on a **poster** or as a slideshow on a
  computer.

  ## Rubric

  The project will be graded with the following rubric:

  <table class="table table-bordered table-striped" markdown="1">

  </tbody>
  </table>

  <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-gavel"></i> Peer Evaluation

  The first two metrics will be graded by the instructor, but the final five
  metrics will be evaluated based on feedback from your fellow classmates.

  </div>

  To evaluate your peers, use the following [form](https://forms.gle/yVcUdoFBRP8iCeEPA):

  <div class="text-center">

  </div>

  ## Deliverables

  Once you have organized your group, please have one group member fill out the following [form](https://forms.gle/upWdiXMz9emGHnXZ9):

  <div class="text-center">
  <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdexeGwlrDaWQnxPxh9lSRETC4QkdvJECoMTnCiZwYqN8NpMw/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="1377" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading…</iframe>
  </div>

  <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  **Note**, while you can always update your submission whenever you have your
  proposal, code repository, and presentation slides, I would recommend
  creating place-holder links that you fill-in later (ie. create empty slides
  for the proposal and presentation and then update those documents later).
