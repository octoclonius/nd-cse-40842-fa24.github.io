  ## Readings

  The readings for this week are:

  1. [Beating the Averages](http://paulgraham.com/avg.html)

  2. [The Hundred-Year Language](http://paulgraham.com/hundred.html)

  3. [Revenge of the Nerds](http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html)

  ## Reflections

  In these essays, [Paul Graham] discusses the power of [programming languages]
  such as [Lisp] and how this non-conventional language proved to be a
  competitive advantage in creating [Viaweb]:

  > Our secret weapon, [Lisp], was similar. We wrote our software in a weird AI
  language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses. For years it had annoyed
  me to hear [Lisp] described that way. But now it worked to our advantage. In
  business, there is nothing more valuable than a technical advantage your
  competitors don't understand. In business, as in war, surprise is worth as
  much as force.

  For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
  perform the readings and participate in class:

  1. Discuss the idea behind the statement: "programming languages are not just
  technology, but what programmers think in."  How does a programming language
  impact the way you tackle a problem or construct an application?

  2. Discuss whether or not "programming languages vary in power."  Are some
  languages intrinsically more powerful than other languages?  What makes one
  language **better** than another?

  3. Discuss your experiences with alternative languages such as [Lisp],
  [Scheme], [Erlang], [Haskell], [Rust], [Zig] or any less popular language.
  What drew you to these languages?  Did you find them to be useful?  Do you
  still use them?  Explain why or why not.

  Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
  Instead, the questions are there to help you brainstorm about the question:

  > How important is the choice of [programming language] in software
  development and computer science?  What is lacking in our current set of
  tools?  What ideas or features will continue to persist far into the future?
