<h2 id="reflections">Reflections<a class="headerlink" href="#reflections" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In these essays, <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">ESR</a> discusses the economics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">open source</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To many people, the successes of the open-source community seem like an implausible form of magic. High-quality software materializes ``for free'', which is nice while it lasts but hardly seems sustainable in the real world of competition and scarce resources. What's the catch? Is Ceridwen's cauldron just a conjuring trick? And if not, how does ephemeralization work in this context—what spell is the goddess speaking?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
perform the readings and participate in class:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In regards to selling software, <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">ESR</a> argues that there is more value in selling services on top of software than selling software itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The foregoing begins to give us some insight into why open-source
software increasingly poses not merely a technological but an economic
challenge to the prevailing order. The effect of making software `free',
it seems, is to force us into that service-fee–dominated world—and to
expose what a relatively weak prop the sale value of the secret bits in
closed-source software was all along.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you make of this idea of "services instead of software" business
model?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To summarize the trade-off between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">open source</a> and proprietary software,
<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">ESR</a> remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The closed-source approach allows you to collect rent from your secret
bits; on the other hand, it forecloses the possibility of truly
independent peer review. The open-source approach sets up conditions for
independent peer review, but you don't get rent from your secret bits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When is it better to "collect rent" and when is it better to have
"independent peer review"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In his final conclusion on "life after the revolution", <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">ESR</a> predicts</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Infrastructure (the Internet, the Web, operating systems, and the lower
levels of communications software that has to cross boundaries between
competing parties) will be almost all open source, cooperatively
maintained by user consortia and by for-profit distribution/service
outfits with a role like that of Red Hat today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does this prediction hold up in today's cloud dominated world and the
rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model">open core</a> business models?</p>
<p>Is the rise of "open core" a positive or negative development for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">open
source</a>?  How should <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">open source</a> projects handle the situations of
large service providers taking their source code to power their
infrastructure, but contributing little back (at least financially)?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
Instead, the questions are there to help you brainstorm about the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">open source</a> still make business sense?  How can the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">open source</a>
movement be sustained and funded in the future?  Is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">open source</a>
business model broken or does the magic cauldron still have power?</p>
</blockquote>
