  ## Reflections

  In these essays, [Paul Graham] discusses the process of creating a [startup]
  and the generation of wealth in general:

  > Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole
  working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low intensity for
  forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four. This pays
  especially well in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.

  For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
  perform the readings and participate in class:

  1. What do you make of [Paul Graham]'s pitch about [startup]s:

      > If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best bet
      would be to start or join a startup. That's been a reliable way to get
      rich for hundreds of years.

      Do you find the possibility of creating your company enticing or
      frightening?  Is this something you have pursued before or wish to pursue
      in the future?  Do you wish to retire early or work for a long time?

  2. What do you make of [Paul Graham]'s justification of [income inequality]:

      > Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to decrease
      other gaps. A hundred years ago, the rich led a different kind of life
      from ordinary people. They lived in houses full of servants, wore
      elaborately uncomfortable clothes, and travelled about in carriages drawn
      by teams of horses which themselves required their own houses and
      servants. Now, thanks to technology, the rich live more like the average
      person.

      Is technological progress and possible improvement in living conditions
      worth a widening incoming gap?  Do we "unshackle" the "wealth creators"
      or should we, as a society, "steal" from them?

  3. Finally, [Paul Graham] made his fortune by targeting the web.  What do you
  think is the next big technological platform? IOT? Wearables? VR? Web?
  Mobile? Desktop? If you had to make an application today, what would you
  target and why?

  Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
  Instead, the questions are there to help you brainstorm about the question:

  > What does the success of modern hackers such as [Paul Graham] say about our
  present society and its future?  Should our society and culture encourage
  risk taking and starting businesses?  What is the next big thing?
